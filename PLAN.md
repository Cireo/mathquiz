# Elementary Math Quiz Game - Project Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

An engaging, locally-playable math quiz game designed for elementary school children. The game will test basic arithmetic skills with cute visual effects and motivational features to keep children engaged.

## ðŸŽ® Core Functionality

### Math Operations
- **Addition**: 1-2 digit numbers (e.g., 7 + 5, 23 + 17)
- **Subtraction**: 1-digit and low 2-digit numbers (e.g., 8 - 3, 25 - 12)
- **Multiplication**: Numbers 0-12 (times tables practice)
- **Division**: 
  - Dividing by 1-5 (simple division)
  - Inverse operations of Ã—2 and Ã—10

### Difficulty Levels
1. **Beginner**: Single-digit addition/subtraction, multiplication by 0-5
2. **Intermediate**: 2-digit addition, low 2-digit subtraction, multiplication by 6-10
3. **Advanced**: Mixed operations, multiplication by 11-12, division

## ðŸŽ¨ Engaging Elements

### Visual Features
- **Colorful UI**: Bright, child-friendly color scheme
- **Cute Characters**: Simple animated mascot/characters
- **Visual Feedback**: Stars, sparkles, or confetti for correct answers
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars and level indicators

### Motivational Features
- **Streak Counter**: Track consecutive correct answers
- **Score System**: Points for correct answers, bonus for streaks
- **Achievements**: Badges for milestones (10 correct, 5 in a row, etc.)
- **Encouraging Messages**: Positive reinforcement for attempts

## ðŸ›  Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: CSS with animations and transitions
- **Local Storage**: Save progress and high scores
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript for simplicity

```

### Core Classes/Modules

#### MathEngine
- Generate random problems based on operation and difficulty
- Validate answers
- Track problem types and difficulty progression

#### GameState
- Manage current score, streak, level
- Handle timer functionality
- Save/load progress

#### UIController
- Handle user interactions
- Update display elements
- Trigger animations and effects

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Minimal but Effective Tests
- **Math Engine Tests**: Verify correct problem generation and answer validation
- **Game Logic Tests**: Test scoring, streak counting, level progression
- **Manual Testing**: UI interactions and visual feedback

### Testing Framework
- Simple JavaScript testing (no external frameworks)
- Browser-based test runner for easy local testing

## ðŸ“± User Experience Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: Choose difficulty level and game mode
2. **Game Screen**: 
   - Display math problem
   - Input area for answer
   - Submit button
   - Current score and streak display
3. **Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers
4. **Progress**: Show level completion and unlocked achievements
5. **Results**: End-of-session summary with encouragement
